# hello-world
1st repository created for exploring and venturing into IT in Education environment
Hi All, vsss001 here. This is my 1st time here to learn ways of improving myself and improving individual work productivity with the hope to make life better for myself as well as for others. Let this be the 1st step of my journey to harness knowledge, skills and methodologies that could one day let me break through all the obstacles that stands in my way in order to unlock the hidden solution which had been kept away by lazy bugz for their own selfish benefits on the expense of others misery. With the ultimate goal to eliminate those corrupted bugz from their existing places and let the helpful individuals be there instead so as to restore order and reward those who deserve it more, rather than waste it on those lazy useless bugz who doesn't deserve those benefits.
